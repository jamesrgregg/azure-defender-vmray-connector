## Current State Analysis

### Original Implementation Challenges

1. **Security Concerns**
   - Connection strings and API keys stored in application settings
   - Direct public access to Azure resources
   - No managed identity implementation
   - Lack of centralized secret management
   - No encryption in transit enforcement
   - Absence of application monitoring

2. **Operational Risks**
   - Manual key rotation process
   - No standardized logging or monitoring
   - Limited ability to audit access
   - Potential for credential exposure
   - No network isolation
