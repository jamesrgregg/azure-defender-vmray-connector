I am tasked with the implementation of vmray-defender connector using a flex consumption plan for the function app.  I want the resource group named rg-vmray-sec-wus3-dev. All bicep code should be added to a bicep folder with a folder structure of bicep/subscriptions/DEV.  I want the bicep file to be named after the resource group and the bicepparam file to be named after the resource group.  All bicep params will need to be added to the bicepparam file.  

The deployment region is west us 3. Finally, the existing resources are created in the same subscription, so the target scope is resource group.
